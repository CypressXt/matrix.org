## What we are trying to achieve

The Matrix Foundation is in charge of various activities revolving around Matrix. One of the most important activities to make Matrix a mainstream protocol is lowering the barrier to entry for the general public. The Matrix.org website is a critical step of the onboarding: this is what people will stumble upon when they look up “what is Matrix chat” or “chatting on Matrix” in a search engine.

**The primary mission of the matrix.org website is to onboard various populations on Matrix, and turn them into supporters of the project.**

We identified 4 different kind of populations that we want to address with the Matrix.org website.

- **Everyday people** who want to use Matrix for instant messaging with family and friends. They are not tech savvy and just want simple steps to follow, and something that "just works™". They don't particularly care about Matrix. They could use WhatsApp or Signal.
- **Community managers** who want to find a platform for their community to talk on. They could use Slack or Discord.
- **Developers** who want to create clients, servers, bridges or bots. They are tech literate and are interested in how things work from a technical perspective. They are already convinced Matrix is useful and want either to create toys for it, or Matrix-based tools for production.
- **Entrepreneurs** who were told about Matrix and who need to see how it can bring value to them to create products based on Matrix.

## How we measure progress

The tools we have at our disposal are:

- Privacy-preserving analytics with Plausible.io ([rationale here](https://ergaster.org/posts/2024/01/24-tracking-what-works/)). They allow us to track which are the most popular pages, custom events (e.g. to track if a call to action is often clicked on or not), and funnels
- User feedback, which will necessarily suffer the survivor bias
